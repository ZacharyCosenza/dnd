# DND as Test Case for Github Stuff

This is a basic exploration of recent DND notes. We generate basic statistics over our domain (notes generated by a member of our party) as well as sentiment scores using FLAN-T5 LLM (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/flan-t5), an open-source language model.

Here are some descriptive statistics of the notes over time.

Here is the running and cumulative average of sentiment of the notes as determined by the LLM (positive, negative, neutral). Clearly, the model judged the overall sentiment of the campaign as broadly negative, which comports with our gameplay style of violence.

## Rules

1. Don't work on `main` branch unless small updates
